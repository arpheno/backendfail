**backendfail**

backendfail is a place where server side
behaviour can be displayed to explain complex code.

We try to make it easier for beginners to start programming
backend frameworks like [django](https://djangoproject.org) or
[rails]().

At the same time it is a great tool to answer questions on
question and answer portals like [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com).
